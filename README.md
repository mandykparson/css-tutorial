## Box Model
CSS is all boxes
Boxes behave differently depending on their display value
You can control this by using extrinsic sizing, or, you can continue to let the browser make decisions for you based on the content size, using intrinsic sizing.
When content is too big for the box it is in, we call this overflow. You can manage how an element handles overflow content, using the overflow property. Overflow:auto or overflow:scroll will screate space in the padding.
The four main areas of the box model: content box, padding box, border box and margin box.
Margin box holds outline and box-shadow. They don't effect what's inside since these are painted on top.
